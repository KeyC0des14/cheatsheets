# SQL Sample Tables and Data

This folder contains several sample/demo data you can use in your applications, such as:

* Grocery Store sample
* General Business sample

NOTE: These are meant to be SIMPLE. Even though they contain tables meant to be joined, please do not add foreign key constraints, etc. The idea is the SQL should be simple for first-time students to read.

Please DO NOT get carried away with these tables. Please try to keep them to one or two tables per sample. (i.e. Don't turn it into a massive Northwind database.)
