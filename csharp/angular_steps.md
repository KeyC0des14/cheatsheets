Steps for creating an angular app with bash shell and VS Code.

From bash shell, go to your dev folder and type the following (but replace "myapp" with the name of your app):

```bash
ng new myapp
cd myapp
code .
```

When you want to create an interface, **make sure you're in the myapp folder** and type the following (but replace "pet" with the name of your interface):
```bash
ng generate interface pet
```

When you want to create a component, **make sure you're in the myapp folder** and type the following (but replace "show-pet" with the name of your component):
```bash
ng generate component show-pet
```
