# Text Editors!

There are lots of great text editors out there! Here are some of our favorites.

But first: Why would you get a good text editor when you have Visual Studio or VS Code? Because often you want to quickly open up just one or two files without a full IDE!

## SciTE

The SciTE editor has been around many years and they continue to add to it.

For **Windows** users, find it here: https://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDownload.html and under Windows grab the "Full 64 bit download." Download it, unzip it, and add its folder to your system path. (Remember to restart your shells to pick it up.)

For **Linux** use your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, use ``apt install scite``. It will be automatically added to your path and you won't need to restart your shell.

Tip: Learn how to open your editor from the command line, both Windows CMD and Bash! (This involves adding it to the path.)
